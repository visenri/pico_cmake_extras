# pico_cmake_extras
Some extra cmake functions for raspberry pi pico SDK


For now, just one function:

**pico_generate_pio_header_pre:**

    This function works like "pico_generate_pio_header" but parsing previously the file with gcc preprocessor
    It generates two files:
        - A .ppio file with the preprocessed .pio file.
        - The usual header file generated by Pioasm from the .ppio file.  
        
    The usual c preprocessing stuff can be used: #include, #define, #if, #ifdef...
    
    Motivation:
    Sometimes, I find usefull to have preprocessing in asm files, to use different asm depending on externally defined macros.
    I hope other people may find it useful.
    
    
**Usage:**

    Just include it in your CMakelists.txt:
    
    include(pico_extras.cmake)
